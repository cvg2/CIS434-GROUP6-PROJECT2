We decided to organize the game in those tasks so when we get to the last week she should be testing, debugging and trying to optimizie the code as much as we can:
  Define the game rules.
  Set up the chessboard.
  Implement the game logic.
  Add a user interface.
  Implement game features.
  Test and debug.
  Optimize.
